"""
Zero-Trust Policy Engine for contextual access control.

Implements prioritized policy rules that evaluate contextual signals
(device trust, geo-risk, time-of-day, identity) alongside ML risk scores
to make access decisions. Designed for defense-in-depth against adversarial
evasion: even when ML is fooled, contextual policies catch anomalous access
patterns.

Policy Architecture:
    Rules are evaluated in strict priority order (1 = highest). The first
    rule whose condition is satisfied determines the access decision. This
    mirrors real Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA) policy engines where
    micro-segmentation rules take precedence over broader contextual checks.

Attacker Threat Model Assumption:
    An attacker who crafts adversarial network flows is assumed to operate
    from an unregistered device (low device trust) and a geographically
    anomalous IP address (high geo-risk). This is a documented modeling
    assumption, not an empirical calibration. See context_profiles.py for
    the distributional parameters.
